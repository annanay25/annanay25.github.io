# Cornell Tech Survival Guide

Welcome to the CTSG. ðŸš€

This is a dynamic document that will be updated through the year with activity highlights of the 2022 batch, and will (hopefully) live on to serve the future batches. It will be a collective contribution of the batch and aim to include the best experiences from everyone.

Without further ado, a list of the best at Cornell Tech in roughly chronological order 

- Register for all possible courses in pre-enrolment (or at least try) only to drop them all by the add/drop deadlines.
- Click to enrol in classes **on the dot** at the time mentioned or prepare to sit in the waitlist and watch the others attend your beloved classes ðŸ›Ž
- Visit the rooftop at The House at least once everyday to play pool and take pictures
- Play your first Beer Pong
- Talk about how good the view is, from The House, lawns and even the classrooms

- Visit Central Park, Times Square and the Washington State Park - some have even done this on foot.
- Use the Roosevelt Island Red Bus - its free and the fastest way to get around the island
