title: Career Progression in a Tech Company

From my (limited) experience of working as a software developer in a SaaS company, I believe the most
effective way to make an impact on a company and grow your professional career is to stay close to the
cost centers. This can mean one of few things - 

- work on products that are making the most revenue within the company
- optimise and reduce costs of running software in the cloud
- refer companies and help bring in sales / new customers
