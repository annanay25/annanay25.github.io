SCaLE (Southern California Linux Expo) 21x was held on 15-17th March 2024 in Pasadena, LA. I was lucky enough to present a talk titled "[So you want to build an Incident Response stack using OpenTelemetry?](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x/presentations/so-you-want-build-incident-response-stack-using-opentelemetry)".

We also had a booth there from Grafana:

The vibes were immaculate. It felt a lot less enterprise-y and had a lot of hackers building fun stuff - both hardware and software. Here's my favourite one:

On first glance it looks like a regular Soda dispenser. But the makers have actually ripped the insides out and replace it with a server rack. 
You can put quarters in, choose the flavor of Linux, and it will spin it up on the server rack inside the dispenser.
It will also print a receipt with the SSH credentials to log into the VM!

Now I want to go to FOSDEM.
