My setup

1. Need something to cut Vinyl! Vinyl cutting machine - [Cricut Maker 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WGB21KR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) was a decent place to start.
2. Base materials - I used some [4x16 aluminum sheets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZDDHLNX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and some [12x12 Plexiglass sheets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCWQF53H?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title).
3. [Transfer tape](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0943DQ9CD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - Need this to transfer vinyl onto the base material. 
4. [Cold roll laminator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7AQMAS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) - used to remove any air bubbles while pressing the vinyl onto the base material.
5. Layering - If you want multiple colours, just repeat the process!
