I am a Staff Software Engineer on the AI/ML team at Grafana Labs. I am passionate about building data-driven systems that have a positive impact on society.

I'm currently working alongside an amazing team to build an Agentic LLM that lives inside Grafana and helps you build dashboards, run investigations and reason about your telemetry data.

Previously I:
- co-created [Grafana Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/): a high performance, open source, distributed tracing backend.
- was a Graduate student in Computer Science at Cornell University. Read about my Fall 2022 semester [here]([url](https://annanay25.github.io/Cornell-Tech-Fall-Wrapped/)).
- have given talks at
  - KubeCON India 2025: [Auto-instrumentation for GPU performance using eBPF](https://youtu.be/eEBAFyLB9Zg?si=8HS9tSWTVuahkzcq)
  - FOSDEM 2025: [Auto-instrumentation for GPU performance using eBPF](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5162-auto-instrumentation-for-gpu-performance-using-ebpf/).

  - Bangalore Observability Meetup: [Tempo, Path to 1M spans/sec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LELhbs09cc).
- was a Site Reliability Engineer at @media.net handling the infrastructure for a Spam Detection Engine.
- worked on open-source observability projects including Jaeger and OpenTelemetry.
- spent 4 amazing undergraduate years studying Computer Science at IIT Hyderabad.
  - Where I worked on [Compiler Optimisations for TensorFlow using LLVM and Polly](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/slides/Agarwal-Enabling%20Polyhedral%20optimizations%20in%20TensorFlow%20through%20Polly.pdf).
