A few weeks back I read a blog about a [custom Apple Wallet Pass](https://drobinin.com/posts/how-i-accidentally-became-puregyms-unofficial-apple-wallet-developer/) someone built for their gym access
because they got frustrated with how long the app would take to load it.

That was super cool and I love when developer hacks like this become popular.

The blog made me think about what else I could add into my Wallet and soon enough I was trying to cram my Github contributions chart into it. Cuz, what a cool party trick that would be.

A couple hours of figuring out the Wallet API and I had a website to enter any github username and it would generate a realistic mobile pass preview:

I could then add this to my Google Wallet, here's what it looks like on my phone:

It says "TEST ONLY" because I didn't want to create a real Google Business profile which is needed for companies that create wallet passes, but the pass looks beautiful on my phone!
